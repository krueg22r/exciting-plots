My phd work focuses on accurately predicting fluorescence energies
from aromatic exciplexes -- excited states that extend over multiple 
molecules. Exciplex formation is part of the photoresponse of systems 
ranging from DNA to solar cells to burning flames! 

The jupyter notebooks in this repository include examples of several 
types of plots I've produced using Matplotlib, Pandas, and my own 
small plotting library, rplot. 

BindCurveGrid contains a first attempt at producing multiple subplots, 
along with spline fits. 

ExciplexScatter contains an example scatter plot. The raw data is processes
extensively using Pandas, a linear fit curve is added, and points are 
labeled using the adjustText package.
